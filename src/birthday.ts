Happiest Birthday, ${BIRTHDAY_NAME}! 🎂💖

I still remember **20 February 2023**, the very first day at uni. That was the start of me secretly staring at you in lectures, pretending to understand equations when really I was calculating the exact probability of bumping into you in the hallway. Spoiler: it was always 100% because I somehow “accidentally” managed it every time.

Then came **October 9, 10, 11**—those three days that live rent-free in my head. That Truth and Dare if that didn't happend then I don't think any of this will ever happend. The late talks, the tiny confessions, the way I realized that “oh no, this isn’t just a crush anymore, I’m in deep trouble.” Trouble that tasted like chai, laughter, and the kind of honesty you don’t get every day. Each word you said in those days felt like it unlocked a new level of me falling for you more and more. 💖

Since then, it’s been a constant graph going up, no dips, feelings for you always on rise me falling harder every single day. Infinity times infinity ♾️ × ♾️. 

You being from my friend to my everything. You being my bestie to my tutor you are my everything.💓

From the first nervous “hi” (me asking for notes while sitting on Jay-e-namaz to running into washroom after the message🤣) to every goofy laugh, from that February spark to those October fireworks, all the way to today—I just keep discovering new reasons to admire you. You’re my unexpected plot twist, my favorite assignment, and the only group project I’ll happily carry until forever ♾️.

So here’s to you, Amna—the girl who turned normal days into highlights, lectures into comedy specials, and my heart into a never-ending confetti cannon. Happy Birthday once again! I hope this little site makes you smile as wide as you made me on 20 Feb and on those October nights.
